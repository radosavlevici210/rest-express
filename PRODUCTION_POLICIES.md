# Production Policies & Guidelines

## ðŸ”’ Security Policies

### Data Protection
- All user data is validated and sanitized before processing
- No sensitive information is logged or exposed in error messages
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP)
- CORS configured for production domains only
- Helmet.js provides comprehensive security headers

### Authentication & Authorization
- API endpoints are protected with rate limiting
- Input validation on all user-provided data
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries (when using databases)
- XSS protection through content security policies

### Infrastructure Security
- Production environment uses HTTPS only
- Security headers enforced (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- No sensitive data in environment variables exposed to client
- Regular security updates for dependencies

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Logging

### Health Monitoring
- `/health` endpoint provides comprehensive system status
- `/api/monitor` endpoint for detailed production metrics
- Memory usage tracking and alerts
- Request/response time monitoring
- Error rate tracking with detailed logging

### Performance Monitoring
- Response time tracking for all endpoints
- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU usage tracking
- Request volume monitoring
- Error rate tracking

### Logging Standards
- All requests logged with timestamp, IP, method, path
- Error logging with context and stack traces (development only)
- Performance metrics logged for monitoring
- No sensitive data in logs (passwords, tokens, personal data)

## ðŸš€ Deployment Standards

### Environment Configuration
- Production environment detection
- Environment-specific CORS policies
- Production-optimized middleware configuration
- Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
